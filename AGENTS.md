# Repository instructions

## Setup and validation

- Use `CONTRIBUTING.md` for setup and required validation commands; `package.json` and the lockfile own dependency requirements and resolved versions.
- For code changes, run the complete automated validation prescribed in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- Builds clear the contents of `dist/com.xonika9.codex-deck.sdPlugin`, including logs. If that directory is linked to a live Stream Deck plugin, preserve required diagnostics and run validation in an isolated copy without links to the active `dist`.
- Follow `TESTING.md` when writing, changing, or removing tests.
- `test/release-docs.test.ts` checks `README.md` and `.claude/skills/release/references/checks.md`. When either document changes, run that test using the runner documented in `TESTING.md`.
- Never create branches — always commit and work directly on `main`.
- After building release artifacts, run the release audit prescribed in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- Report automated, live-app, and physical-device validation separately. Never describe fixture, compile, build, or package validation as physical-device testing.

## Project invariants

- Develop primarily for Mac and preserve standalone Windows installation, startup, and existing actions. Preserve supported task-source scenarios documented in `README.md` and `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, including local OpenCode and saved Fedora SSH connections. Fedora is a chat source, not a Stream Deck plugin platform.
- Do not reintroduce the iPhone application, its infrastructure, or the separate multi-host Codex relay without a separate product decision. Preserve and ignore legacy private settings. Removing other supported functions also requires a separate decision.
- Keep the Codex Chrome DevTools endpoint bound to loopback. Do not expose, forward, or rebind it to a network interface; preserve the authenticated, identity-checked OpenCode SSH path documented in `SECURITY.md`.
- Do not add hotkey or task-database fallbacks to the native bridge without a separate design decision.
- Keep usage actions read-only. Preserve the legacy reset-credit action UUID for existing profiles; consuming credits on press or hold requires a separate product decision.
- Do not commit or distribute proprietary OpenAI or Elgato assets, Codex installation files, databases, logs, rollout files, pairing tokens, personal paths, private runtime state, or generated release bundles. Provider logos (OpenAI/Codex, Anthropic/Claude, OpenCode) that mark which provider a usage key displays are exempt from this rule.
- Update compatibility notes when renderer integration behavior changes.

See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for the pull-request contract and `SECURITY.md` for the complete security boundary.

Use public `#area` entry points between source areas; follow the import direction in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`. Native boundary checks require ordinary ESM imports, including `import type`, rather than inline import types or `require`.

Keep task sources independent of one another. Keep the shared queue independent of I/O and the Stream Deck SDK, and keep the launcher independent of that SDK. Follow `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for module responsibilities and integration boundaries.

## Performance

Performance notes for this repository live in `docs/maintenance/performance/`.

- Before changing code for speed, memory, load, or cost, read `docs/maintenance/performance/README.md` and the recent entries of `docs/maintenance/performance/journal.md`; do not retry an approach the journal records as rejected without new evidence.
- Keep any wait, retry, or limit that the notes or a code comment mark as a guard, unless the condition it protects is handled another way.
- Claim a performance gain only with before-and-after numbers measured as `docs/maintenance/performance/README.md` describes, and record the attempt in the journal, including reverted ones.

## Execution discipline

Shared defaults from the `x9-context-files-generator` template. Repository-specific instructions outside this block take precedence. Local contains optional pointers to existing project resources.

- Use the project's existing verification tools. Do not build a separate acceptance framework merely to verify a routine change.
- After a check fails, run the failing check and checks affected by its fix. Repeat a previously passing check when the change could invalidate its result or the project requires a fresh run.
- Keep code comments focused on non-obvious reasons, invariants, and workarounds. Preserve license notices and useful API documentation; avoid narrating the code.

## Documentation discipline

Shared defaults from the `x9-context-files-generator` template. Repository-specific instructions outside this block take precedence. Local contains optional pointers to existing project resources.

- Update current documentation affected by a change. Preserve historical plans and research as historical evidence rather than silently rewriting them to describe the present.
- Keep setup and verification procedures in their existing scripts or documentation, with concise entry points in README or agent instructions where useful.
- Keep current work status in its existing home; do not maintain competing status summaries across documents.
- For documentation-only changes, run the applicable documentation checks and inspect changed repository-relative links. Run code checks when the change affects what they verify.
- Use a tool's configured artifact location instead of creating a parallel directory.

## Compound Engineering

Shared overrides from the `x9-context-files-generator` template. Explicit user and repository instructions take precedence. Local records existing project facts and scoped delegations; project-specific workflow rules belong outside this block.

These rules bind every Compound Engineering executor that plans or implements a delivery stage and take precedence over skill defaults. The acceptance lead is the user or an agent or role the user has explicitly authorized to accept this work. This block neither requires a CTO nor creates another project role.

- Any work, including review, planning, and implementation, may use a model from another provider configured in this environment and give it the private-repository content the work needs, without separate confirmation. Inside T3 Code, launch such a worker through T3 `delegate_task`, not through a skill's own launcher such as `ce-work` cross-model execution, so the user can see and stop it in the app.
- Multi-model work (Bake-off candidates, oracle panels, cross-model review) uses only Claude and GPT families unless the user asks otherwise.
- For a planned delivery stage, the accepted Verification Contract names one stage acceptance command and its machine-readable output, reusing existing checks where possible. Ordinary tasks without a delivery-stage contract keep their existing verification requirements; this block alone does not require a new runner. Do not reclassify an accepted stage to bypass its contract. The stage contract marks each acceptance row as `blocking` or `hardening`. A row is `blocking` when the plan's Definition of Done, an accepted decision, or another source named in Local requires it. A row is `hardening` only when those owners explicitly allow it to remain non-blocking; fault injection alone does not make a row `hardening`. Unlabelled rows in an existing plan are `blocking`.
- Before implementing a planned delivery stage, identify its required outcomes, planning-time technical decisions, affected processes and stores, independent risk seams, independently observable result, smallest bounded acceptance boundary, and likely implementation-unit range. Use the plan's own unit identifiers; no separate work registry or global numbering scheme is required.
- Assess depth against the accepted outcome under the smallest viable design that preserves every required behavior and boundary. Assess the proposed technical construction separately. Unit count, one language, one directory family, or claimed linear sequencing do not lower depth.
- When a proposed construction makes the plan `Deep` but a smaller conforming design keeps the required outcome `Lightweight` or `Standard`, reject the construction and replan the same outcome. Do not split the product scope solely because of construction-induced depth. New reusable proof machinery triggers a necessity check: remove it when no accepted requirement needs it; otherwise include it in the smallest viable design and reassess depth.
- When a required outcome remains `Deep` under the smallest viable design, stop dependent implementation and propose smaller outcome boundaries for the user's approval without weakening that outcome. Do not create extra aggregate or closeout work solely to manage a numbering scheme.
- The acceptance inventory names the smallest boundary that certifies the observable result and defaults to thin aggregation of existing checks. It does not by itself authorize a new evidence schema, DSL, validator, baseline-evolution mechanism, runner mode, proof store, or proof platform.
- Under `ce-work`, the preferred practice becomes a requirement: run every implementation unit in its own fresh subagent, run the checks named in the unit's `Verification` field, and commit the unit before starting the next. The final report lists each unit with its commit SHA. A multi-unit stage delivered as one commit is rejected at acceptance. A unit already satisfied without changes records its verification and the existing commit that supplies it instead of creating an empty commit.
- Acceptance results come only from the output file of the stage's acceptance script, run on a tree where `git status` reports no changes. The runner must reject a dirty starting tree and source changes during the run. A dirty tree does not authorize committing, stashing, or discarding unrelated work; stop only the dependent acceptance until an authorized clean candidate is available. Cite that file; any stated status or count must be derived from it, not reconstructed manually. Scripts run by hand may be listed as work performed, not as results.
- A narrowly scoped exception applies only when the owner explicitly approves an acceptance-lead closeout from retained stage outputs and focused primary evidence, and the owning plan or existing canonical decision source records that amended contract; do not create a decision log merely for this exception. The acceptance lead records source applicability, unresolved conditions, and the decision separately. This is a closeout decision, not a newly executed stage acceptance; never fabricate or relabel machine statuses, counts, or reports.
- In a standalone `ce-work` run for a delivery stage, the stage acceptance script is the first stage-level quality check. Until every `blocking` row passes, keep implementing or use `ce-debug`; do not invoke `ce-simplify-code` or `ce-code-review`. This override also disables simplify-as-you-go and the post-fix simplify/review steps of any `ce-debug` run before that first passing acceptance. For a stage with a paid external action, first run the stage script in a mode that excludes paid actions, regardless of whether credentials are present: every free `blocking` row independent of the final disposable target must pass. Target checks tied to that same environment and the paid row stay `not_proven` until final acceptance. This free result permits the one simplify/review pass; every deferred free row must pass before the paid action.
- After the first passing acceptance, or the passing free portion of a paid stage as above, run the applicable stage-level `ce-simplify-code` pass no more than once. Commit any simplification, require a clean tree, then run one completed full `ce-code-review` and retain its `scope.head_sha` as the reviewed snapshot. A failed review invocation may be retried until it produces a completed receipt.
- While applying review findings, run every check named by the finding and every affected unit's `Verification` field. For a changed file owned by no unit, run the closest applicable layer check and record that mapping as a departure. Commit review-fix batches, then rerun the stage acceptance script on the clean final tree using the smallest acceptance scope allowed by the Verification Contract. Reuse a passing result only with its recorded command, source revision, and evidence that it still applies. A full rerun is not automatic: identify what remains unproven by retained evidence and affected checks, and continue within an already authorized verification scope and budget. Ask the owner before an expensive repeat only when it is outside that grant. If the accepted plan requires every check afresh, propose an explicit contract amendment before using earlier results; do not silently bypass the plan or construct a passing result. For a paid stage, rerun affected free checks after review fixes and perform the paid acceptance on the clean reviewed tree within the already approved target, actions, attempt count, and budget. Ask once for any missing paid authority before the first paid attempt; do not ask again while that grant still covers the action. A later change that affects live proof invalidates that proof, not automatically the existing permission: a new attempt may use remaining approved attempts and budget. If an attempt's outcome is unknown, reconcile it through read-only status or receipts before considering another; do not risk a duplicate paid action. If reconciliation cannot establish a safe permitted next step, stop that action and report the concrete uncertainty.
- Do not repeat the full review for ordinary finding fixes or acceptance reruns. If post-review work materially changes behavior, security, or architecture beyond the reviewed findings, return blocked for an acceptance-lead decision. When the acceptance lead requests another review, run only the delta with `base:<scope.head_sha from the first review>` and wait for its completed result.
- A finding showing that a `blocking` row cannot hold is not residual work: fix it or return blocked. Record every other justified unapplied finding under `Residual findings` in the final report with severity and `file:line`. List review-fix commits alongside implementation-unit commits.
- Unless the user explicitly authorizes a different shipping path, shipping for a delivery stage ends at local commits in the authorized checkout: do not push, open or update a pull request, merge, babysit, or write to a tracker. This is the project-defined shipping process for standalone `ce-work` and an explicit `commit only` override for interactive `ce-debug` runs within the stage. Publication after acceptance follows the user's explicit grant and repository instructions; without one, the owner publishes after acceptance.
- When a rule cannot be followed as written, keep every check and every piece of evidence; among the options that do, choose the smaller change. Record the departure in a `Departures` section of the final report and continue only when no rule requires stopping. A departure cannot waive a plan- or canon-required input, a `blocking` acceptance row, a safety boundary, or an owner decision; return blocked when one of those cannot be satisfied.
